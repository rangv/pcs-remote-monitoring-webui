Azure Remote Monitoring WebUI
=================================

Web app for Azure IoT Remote Monitoring Solution [dotnet](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-dotnet) and [java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-java).

Prerequisites
=============
### 1. Deploy a Remote Monitoring Solution
The easiest way to test the Web UI is against a deployed remote monitoring solution. The solution can be deployed via the [web interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-suite/iot-suite-remote-monitoring-deploy) or via the [command line](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-suite/iot-suite-remote-monitoring-deploy-cli).

It is also possible to [deploy the solution locally](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-suite/iot-suite-remote-monitoring-deploy-local#deploy-the-azure-services).

### 2. Setup Dependencies
1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. For development, you can use your preferred editor
   - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - [Atom](https://atom.io/)
   - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
   -  or other preferred editor

### 3. Environment variables required to run the Web UI
In order to run the Web UI, the environment variables need to be created at least once. More information on configuring environment variables [here](#configuration-and-environment-variables).

* `REACT_APP_BASE_SERVICE_URL` = {your-remote-monitoring-endpoint}

The endpoint given above is the base url you navigate to in order to see your deployed solution.

Build, run and test locally
===========================
* `cd ~\pcs-remote-monitoring-webui\`
* `npm install`
* `npm start`: Launches the project in browser - watches for code changes and refreshes the page.
* `npm run build`: Creates a production ready build.
* `npm test`: Runs test in watch mode, press `q` to quit
* `npm flow`: Runs Flow type checker. Learn more about Flow [here](https://flow.org/).

Project Structure
===========================
The Web UI contains the following sections under [src](src):
- `assets`: Contains assets used across the application. These include fonts,
icons, images, etc.
- `components`: Contains all the application react components. These in include
containers and presentational components.
- `services`: Contains the logic for making ajax calls as well as mapping
request/response objects to front end models.
- `store`: Contains all logic related to the redux store.
- `styles`: Contains sass used across the application mixins, theming, variables,
etc.
- `utilities`: Contains helper scripts used across the application.

Configuration and Environment variables
===========================

The Web UI configuration is stored in [app.config.js](src/app.config.js)

The configuration files in the repository reference some environment
variables that need to be created at least once. Depending on your OS and
the IDE, there are several ways to manage environment variables:

* Windows: the variables can be set [in the system][windows-envvars-howto-url]
  as a one time only task. The
  [env-vars-setup.cmd](scripts/env-vars-setup.cmd) script included needs to
  be prepared and executed just once. The settings will persist across
  terminal sessions and reboots.
* For Linux and OSX environments, the [env-vars-setup](scripts/env-vars-setup)
  script needs to be executed every time a new console is opened.
  Depending on the OS and terminal, there are ways to persist values
  globally, for more information these pages should help:

Contributing to the solution
==============================
Please follow our [contribution guildelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the code style conventions.

### Customizing the solution
Please see our [developer walkthroughs](/docs/walkthrough/README.md) for more information on customizing and adding to the application.
